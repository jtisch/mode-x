        This is my first EVER 100% Assembly Demo i have written, therefore
    if it seems a little crummy thats why... Although this one is in
    "Mode-X", I was able to copy ALL bitmaps to the video memory and ALL
    transferrs from that point are done from within in the Video Card with
    little to no HOST interaction, thus making it rather quick. But oh well,
    check it out, if something is screwed up than let me know, the code is
    ALL here, nothing was left out, I was using TASM and TLINK for the
    compiler and the Linker, but am sure other linkers will work even the
    regular DOS version.  This is NOT to be distributed ANY WHERE ELSE ACCEPT
    for the CODERS within THG/FX, I am not stingy, but think that others
    should get their own understanding and once they reach a point, than
    they are worthy of getting source like this. No one ever gave me code
    until I was a respected coder.. But oh enough said..... The demo can
    be distributed WITHOUT the source to all to enjoy!.
